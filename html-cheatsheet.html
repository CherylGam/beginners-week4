    <h1>Welcome to my Cheat Sheet</h1>
      <p>The h1 tags create a main heading. Think of it as a newspaper headline. h2 is a subheading.</p>
        <p> The p tags indicate a paragraph. Always remember to include your closing tag!! </p>
        <p><em>use an em tag to emphasise words</em></p>
        <p>If I want to use lists I can use ol for numbered lists and ul for bullet points.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This</li>
          <li>is</li>
          <li>a</li>
          <li>list</li>
          </ul>
<p>I like horses and every week I ride a horse called Jack. He is a bit of a <strong>shit.</strong></p>
